Classes: User, Farm, Crop, FarmerProfile, ManagerProfile, ExpertProfile, Task, etc.

Attributes and Methods: Define properties like username, email, password for User, and methods such as authenticate(), assignTask(), updateProfile().

Associations: Show how classes relate, e.g., a Farm can have multiple Crops and Tasks, or a Manager manages multiple Farmers.

Sequence Diagram
A sequence diagram could outline actions such as:

Login: User enters credentials → AuthController validates → User redirected to dashboard.

Identify core entities

User

Farm

Crop

Task

Equipment

Inventory

Weather

Role-based profiles (Farmer, Manager, Expert, Owner)

Define relationships

A user can have one or more roles.

A farm has multiple crops, tasks, and equipment.

A manager can assign tasks to farmers.

Experts can provide recommendations to farms.

Normalize shared data

Keep reusable/linked data (like users, tasks, farms) in separate collections.

Reference IDs instead of duplicating entire objects.
